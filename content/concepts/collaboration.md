description: How users collaborate on Qri
---

1. Anyone can create a key whenever they like
2. Anyone can create a log whenever they want
3. Oplogs are signed by the last author in the history.
4. Inclusion in a dataset history requires a _token_ proving the keypair is a collaborator.
5. Log histories are never merged, they are instead chosen by priority of last writer.


Collaborator tokens must be issued by the dataset owner or a key delegated by the dataset owner. Tokens are external to oplog data structures.
