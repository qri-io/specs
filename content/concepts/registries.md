A Registry is a special kind of _remote_. Just like common remotes 

In addition to being a remote, registries come with some extra capabilities:

* Unique username coordination
* Profile reputation
* Search

Any qri instance can only have either zero or one registry at a given point in time. Registries are not required to operate a qri instance.
