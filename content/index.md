Qri combine networking, versioning, and a rigid document model into a _network of datasets_. The qri dataset format combines raw data with critical supporting data, the version control system tracks changes and identity, and the network allows for decentralized sharing and transfer of datasets. Together, they represent a new way to work with datasets that enables better trust, availability, and accountability.
